This file contains several pieces of a machine learning algorithm.
The "50 Categories Feature Extraction" file is the original work flow for creating a csv containing the extracted features
of the 50_categories folder. The results from this are saved as the "category_vals" CSV and is called later to train the
random forest model. On my machine it took about 30 mins to run the full feature extraction on the 50_categories folder.
The "RandomForestRunner" massages the CSV data into a useable format for machine learning via sklearn. It then trains
a randomforest and tests it on a subset of the 50_categories images. My algorithm is correct about 30% of the time. This evaluation
is done in the final cell of this notebook, run the notebook to confirm if wanted - will call the category_vals CSV that is supplied so no need
to run the full feature extraction. 
The "Feature Extractor" is just the extraction function alone (was used for debugging and is not called in any function).
The "RUN ME" file should be used for grading and evaluation. It contains both portions of the the algorithm - feature extraction
and random forest setup and runner. This file calls the feature extraction on a new tester folder of unknown categories and saves
it as its own CSV of features. It then calls both CSV's for the trianing and the testing data, reformats the data, trains a random
forest, and the uses the model to predict the categories of the unknown images in the tester folder. Define YOUR path to the testing
folder in the first cell of this notebook and then run this notebook cell by cell. Depending on the size of the testing folder, the feature 
extraction might take a few minutes. This notebook returns both a text file of the filenames and their predicted categories and a pandas
dataframe as a CSV file containing the same information.
