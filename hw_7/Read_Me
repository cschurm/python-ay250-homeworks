Each problem 1 and Problem 2 are in separate notebooks. 
Just run the single cell in each to run.
Problem 2 calls the Problem2.py file that will execute the stitching algorithm.
Problem2.py can be viewed in the Problem 2 notebook or individually.
Results from stitching are saved as a .png file in the HW7 directory.
